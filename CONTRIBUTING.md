# Contributing to medkit-lib

Thank you for your interest into medkit! This page will guide you through the steps to follow in order to contribute code to the project.

## Contributing process

`medkit` workflow is based on the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) branching model. 
Our default branch `main` is the development branch and will contain the most up-to-date version of the code. Releases (stable versions) will be managed using tags on the default branch. For minor release updates, we will use `release-a.b.x` branch starting from the `a.b.0` tag.

All contributions may be made using feature and bugfixes branches started from `main` branch.
Once tested, reviewed and approved, they will be merged back into `main`. 

The medkit contributing process is as follows:

- fork the project into your personal space
- before creating a new branch, open an [issue](https://github.com/TeamHeka/medkit/issues/new) describing the bug or the feature you will be working on, unless there is already an existing issue.
- in your fork, create a branch from `main` and name it with a short description: `<issue-id>-<short-description>` (without the `#` character).
- start working by adding commits to this branch. Try to have clear [commit messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/). Do not forget to also write tests in the `tests/`directory if applicable (cf [Tests](#tests)).
- once you are done, check that your code follows our coding standards with `black`and `flake8` (cf [Linting and formatting](#linting-and-formatting)) and that all the tests pass with `pytest` (cf [Tests](#tests))
- open a [pull request](https://github.com/TeamHeka/medkit/compare) (PR). Unit tests and linting/formatting checks will automatically be run on the PR and prevent it from being merged if they fail.
- once all CI checks passed, wait for the review of the medkit maintainers. They will make sure it aligns with the project goals and may ask for some changes.

Once this reviewing phase is over, the pull request will be integrated into `main`, either with a merge, a squash & merge or a rebase, depending on the impact of the merge request and the state of its git history.

## Coding standards

### Code conventions

The medkit codebase follows the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code, which defines several rules among which:
- use 4 spaces (not tabs) per indentation level.
- use `snake_case` for variable and functions, `CamelCase` for classes and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants defined at module level.
- prefix non-public variables, methods, attributes and modules (ie .py files) with a leading underscore.
- avoid `import *`, prefer explicit import.
- use `"double-quoted"` strings rather than `'single-quoted'`.

Note that contrary to PEP8, the maximum line length in medkit is not 79 characters but 88 (for better compatibility with the `black` formatter (cf [Linting and formatting](#linting-and-formatting)).

### Linting and formatting

To format the codebase consistently and enforce PEP8 compliance, we use [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) for code formatting and [flake8](https://github.com/ambv/black) for linting.

Running the command `black <path/to/file.py>` will auto-format the file. Running `flake8 <path/to/file.py>` will display potential infractions to PEP8. Editors such as [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can be configured to do this automatically when editing or saving a file.

Note that every time a pull request is opened or updated, `black` and `flake8` will automatically be run on the codebase and will prevent it from being merged if an error is detected.

As `flake8` may cause dependencies conflicts (importlib-metadata) with
other libraries (e.g., sphinx), we use the linter tools in a separated
environment using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework.

The configuration file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is at the project root.

To run locally these tools, follow these instructions:
```
$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit

# To run on all project files
$ pre-commit run --all-files

# To run only on staged files
$ pre-commit run
```

Note that the tool is launched before each commit on staged changes.

To automatically check and format files locally, you may also use:

```
$ pre-commit run black --hook-stage manual --all-files
```

### Coding style

Some general guidelines to keep in mind:
- code and comments are written in english.
- use readable names for identifiers (variables, functions, etc). Avoid one-letter names and do not overuse abbreviations. Try to use nouns for classes and verbs for functions and methods.
- expose only what is necessary: mark internal function, variables, classes, modules as non-public with a leading underscore (for instance `_perform_internal_task()`).
- group related code into the same Python module (ie .py file), for instance a class and helper function, but avoid packing to many classes in the same module.
- avoid "magic" features such as `hasattr()`/`getattr()`/`setattr()`.
- use [property decorators](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property), rater than `get_`/`set_`methods, to created read-only or computed attributes. Do not use them for complex or expensive logic.

## Tests

`medkit` uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing. Tests are stored in the `tests/` folder in the repository root directory.
All tests files and test functions must be prefixed with `test_`.
It is possible to run a specific test using `pytest path/to/test_file.py::test_func`.

`medkit` tests are composed of:
* small/unit tests which execution does not take much time. These tests are executed for each Merge Request.
* large tests which needs more time to be executed. These tests are used for verifying that there is no regression (TODO: at each integration in development branch).

The structure in the `tests/unit` directory should roughly follow the structure of the `medkit/` source directory itself.
For instance, the tests of the (hypothetical) `medkit/core/text/document.py` module should be in `tests/core/text/test_document.py`.

In `tests/large`, tests do not have a direct counterpart in `medkit/`. This folder is for extensively testing some specific feature and we need to keep these tests separately for clarity.

To execute tests:

```
# For small/unit tests
pytest -v tests/unit

# For large tests
pytest -v tests/large
```

When fixing a bug, it is a good idea to introduce a test in order to:
- demonstrate the buggy behavior.
- make sure the fix actually fixing it (the test should fail before the fix and pass after).
- make sure the bug is not reintroduced later.

When introducing new feature, it is also a good idea to introduce tests in order to:
- demonstrate the typical usage of the new functions and classes.
- make sure they behave as intended in typical use cases.
- if applicable, make sure they behave correctly in specific edge cases.

Each test function should have a name like `test_<tested_module_or_class_or_func>[_<tested_behavior>]` Remember to use [parametrize](https://docs.pytest.org/parametrize.html) when possible, as well as [fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/fixture.html).

## Documentation

Documentation is available in `docs` folder.

If you want to contribute, you need to setup your development environment
(cf. [install guide](docs/user_guide/install.md)).

Once your environment activated, you may build the documentation using:

```
$ cd docs
$ jb build .
```
Then, html docs are generated in `docs/_build/html`.

To transform a notebook into a markdown/myst format, you may use `jupytext`.
e.g.,

```
jupytext --to myst myfile.ipynb
```

Thus, you will be able to integrate this notebook into documentation.

To modify an existing notebook under markdown/myst format, you can also use
`jupyter-notebook` only if `jupytext` is also installed :

```
jupyter notebook myfile.md
```

## For maintainers

Maintainers may directly contribute on [gitlab repository](https://gitlab.inria.fr/heka/medkit/).

The medkit contributing process is as follows:

- before creating a new branch, open an [issue](https://gitlab.inria.fr/heka/medkit/-/issues/) describing the bug or the feature you will be working on, unless there already is an existing issue.
- create a branch from `main` and named with the following convention: `<issue-id>-<short-description>` (without the `#` character).
- start working by adding commits to this branch. Try to have clear [commit messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/). Do not forget to also write tests in the `tests/`directory if applicable (cf [Tests](#tests)).
- once you are done, check that your code follows our coding standards with `black`and `flake8` (cf [Linting and formatting](#linting-and-formatting)) and that all the tests pass with `pytest` (cf [Tests](#tests))
- push your local branch on the Gitlab repository and open a [merge request](https://gitlab.inria.fr/heka/medkit/-/merge_requests) (MR). Unit tests and linting/formatting checks will automatically be run on the MR and prevent it from being merged if they fail.
- once all CI checks passed, wait for the review of other maintainers.
- once approved, you can merge your MR into main.
