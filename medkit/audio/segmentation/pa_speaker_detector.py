# When pyannote and spacy are both installed, a conflict might occur between the
# ujson library used by pandas (a pyannote dependency) and the ujson library used
# by srsrly (a spacy dependency), especially in docker environments.
# srsly seems to end up using the ujson library from pandas, which is older and does not
# support the escape_forward_slashes parameters, instead of its own.
# The bug seems to only happen when pandas is imported from pyannote, not if
# we import pandas manually first.
# So as a workaround, we always import pandas before importing something from pyannote

    Each input segment will be split into several sub-segments corresponding
    to speech turn, and an attribute will be attached to each of these sub-segments
    indicating the speaker of the turn.

    `PASpeakerDetector` uses the `SpeakerDiarization` pipeline from
    `pyannote.audio`, which performs the following steps:

    - perform multi-speaker VAD with a `PyanNet` segmentation model and extract \
    voiced segments ;

    - compute embeddings for each voiced segment with a \
    embeddings model (typically speechbrain ECAPA-TDNN) ;

    - group voice segments by speakers using a clustering algorithm such as
      agglomerative clustering, HMM, etc.
